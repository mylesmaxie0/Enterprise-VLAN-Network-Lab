# ðŸ›œ Enterprise VLAN Network Lab ðŸ›œ

> ### Project Overview
 This project simulates an enterprise network for a medium-sized company with three departments (HR, IT, Sales) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network leverages VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure efficient traffic management, dynamic IP allocation, and secure inter-departmental access control. The project demonstrates proficiency in CCNA-level networking concepts, including subnetting, Cisco IOS configuration, and network troubleshooting.

> ### Project Objectives
- Segment network traffic into three VLANs for HR, IT, and Sales departments.
- Enable inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick configuration.
- Configure DHCP for automatic IP allocation across VLANs.
- Implement ACLs to restrict HR access to IT resources while allowing internet access.
- Verify connectivity and security through ping tests and troubleshooting.

> ### Topology Overview
The topology simulates a medium-sized enterprise network with three departments (HR, IT, Sales), each assigned a VLAN (10, 20, 30). A router-on-a-stick handles inter-VLAN routing, a DHCP server assigns IPs dynamically, and ACLs restrict HR access to IT resources. The network includes switches for department connectivity, a router for routing, and PCs to simulate users.
