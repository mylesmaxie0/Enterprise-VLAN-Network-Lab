# VLAN and DHCP Network Configuration
> ### Project Overview
 This project demonstrates the configuration of three Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) in a Cisco Packet Tracer environment, with a router acting as a DHCP server to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in each VLAN. The network consists of two switches, one router, and nine PCs, divided into three VLANs: VLAN 10 ("Sales"), VLAN 20 ("Engineering"), and VLAN 30 ("IT"). The project showcases VLAN setup, trunk link configuration, inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick, and DHCP configuration, with connectivity tested using the ping command. This project highlights VLAN segmentation, trunking, subinterface configuration, and dynamic IP allocation.

 Key Skills: VLAN Configuration, Inter-VLAN Routing, DHCP, ACLs, Subnetting, Cisco IOS, Network Troubleshooting

> ### Project Objectives
- Configure three VLANs to segment network traffic.
- Set up trunk links between switches and the router to carry VLAN traffic.
- Implement inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick configuration.
- Configure the router as a DHCP server to assign IP addresses dynamically for each VLAN.
- Verify connectivity and DHCP functionality across all VLANs.
- Document the setup process.

> ### Learning Outcomes
- Mastered configuration of multiple VLANs for network segmentation.
- Learned to set up trunk links for VLAN traffic across switches.
- Implemented router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN routing across three VLANs.
- Configured and verified DHCP services for dynamic IP allocation in multiple VLANs.
- Gained experience with Cisco IOS commands for switches, routers, and DHCP.
- Developed skills in network testing, troubleshooting, and documentation.
